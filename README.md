# Within Group

**Built from Within**

Within Group is an advisory and sourcing firm focused on real estate transactions.  
The website is designed to be simple, institutional, and informational, reflecting our approach to clarity, discretion, and execution.

This site serves as a digital presence to:
- Establish legitimacy and brand identity  
- Communicate our focus and operating philosophy  
- Provide a direct channel for inquiries via email

## Structure


- `index.html`  
  Contains all website content and layout.

- `styles.css`  
  Defines typography, colors, spacing, and overall visual design.

- `assets/`

## Design Principles

The site is intentionally:
- Minimal  
- Image-free  
- Institutional  
- Neutral and discreet  
- Informational (not promotional)  

There is no backend, no database, and no form submission service.

All inquiries are handled directly via email:

mailto:info@within-group.com


This approach prioritizes simplicity, privacy, and direct communication.

All “Contact Us” buttons and calls to action use a `mailto:` link that opens the visitor’s email client with:
